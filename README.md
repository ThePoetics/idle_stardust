# Idle Stardust
A small incremental game based off the YouTube Idle Game Tutorial series by [Sable Spirit Studio](https://www.youtube.com/@SableSpiritStudio/videos).

Eventually the goal is to update/refactor the sample code to form the basis of my own idle/clicker game. While it may end up as only a simple re-skin, I am learning a lot about Godot through this project (particularly handlers, signals, and data structures) and look forward to being comfortable and confident enough to make it my own.
